The goal is to streamline the handling of images by automatically resizing them and transferring them to a designated storage location while keeping stakeholders informed through notifications.

# AWS services:
1. AWS Lambda
2. Amazon S3
3. Amazon SNS

# Key Features:
1. Image processing automation: Automatically resize and optimize images upon upload.
2. Secure storage: Store processed images in a secure and reliable S3 bucket.
3. Real-time notifications: Receive immediate updates about image processing via SNS.
4. Scalable architecture: Design for scalability to handle image processing demands.
5. Cost-efficient solution: Leverage AWS serverless technologies to minimize operational costs.
